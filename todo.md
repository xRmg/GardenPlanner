## Phase 1 — Foundation & Smart Suggestions

**Goal**: Clean local-first architecture, IndexedDB persistence, backend AI proxy, rules + AI suggestion engine.

### ✅ Completed

- **1.1–1.5** — Zod schemas, `GardenRepository` interface, Dexie v4, auto-migration from localStorage, JSON export/import
- **1.6** — Decomposed `App.tsx` into 8 custom hooks (`useGardenData`, `usePlantCatalog`, `useSeedlingManager`, `useAreaManager`, `useGardenEvents`, `useOpenRouterSettings`, `useLocationSettings`, `usePlantAILookup`)
- **1.7–1.8b** — Backend AI proxy settings + "Ask AI ✨" plant lookup with 30-day cache; all AI calls routed via `POST /api/ai/chat` (key server-side) → see [`docs/ai-integration-design.md`](docs/ai-integration-design.md)
- **1.9** — Dual-mode suggestion engine: weather service (Open-Meteo), rules engine (7 rules + frost), AI suggestions (10 types, 24h cache), merger, `useSuggestions` hook, wired into `EventsBar`, Dexie v7 (`weatherCache` + `aiSuggestionsCache`), full test suite → see [`docs/suggestion-engine-architecture.md`](docs/suggestion-engine-architecture.md)
- **1.10** — Plant schema enrichment: added richer care fields (`watering`, `growingTips`, spacing/harvest metadata), bundled plant seeding, and `PlantDetailsDialog` care rendering
- **1.11** — Pest + treatment events: added `pest` + `treatment` event types, plant-local pest history, journal mirroring, instance-aware treatment suggestions, and AI-backed treatment options with a custom fallback
- **Testing** — Vitest + schema/repository/rules-engine tests
- **1.13** — Auto-derive `koeppenZone` from lat/lng via Open-Meteo 30-year climate normals; pure `classifyKoppen(T, P, lat)` function; written to `settings.growthZone` when user picks a city in Settings
- **1.12** — Calendar view: month-navigable component showing events, suggestions, and harvest periods for planted crops
- **1.14** — Error boundaries + Sonner toast notifications for async failures, with root crash recovery and surfaced sync/settings/AI failures
- **Bug fixes** — Events + plant placements persisted to Dexie (previously lost on refresh)

### ✅ Phase 1 Complete

- [x] **1.12** — Calendar view: month-navigable component showing events, suggestions, and harvest periods for planted crops
- [x] **1.14** — Error boundaries + Sonner toast notifications for all async failures

## AI Integration Technical Debt

> Findings from code review of AI plumbing (plant lookup + suggestion engine + backend proxy). Fix before adding new AI features.

- [x] **AI-1** *(resolved)* `app/hooks/usePlantAILookup.ts` now routes through the backend-only client path; missing proxy configuration fails closed instead of falling back to a direct browser→OpenRouter call.

- [x] **AI-2** *(resolved)* `app/hooks/usePlantAILookup.ts` passes an empty `apiKey` when using the backend proxy; the browser no longer carries the user key for inference calls.

- [x] **AI-3** *(resolved)* `app/hooks/useOpenRouterSettings.ts` now documents and uses backend validation/storage; the browser no longer calls OpenRouter directly.

- [x] **AI-4** *(resolved)* `backend/src/routes.ts` validates `/api/ai/chat` requests with Zod before forwarding them upstream.

- [x] **AI-5** *(resolved)* Backend comments and settings transport now distinguish stored `byok` state from frontend-safe `server` state.

- [x] **AI-6** *(resolved)* The unused frontend `"proxy"` variant was removed from the active settings schema; future hosted proxy tiers remain documented separately in product-planning docs.

- [x] **AI-7** *(resolved)* AI-enabled guards now use the sanitized frontend settings state consistently.

- [ ] **AI-8** *(LOW — inconsistency)* `app/hooks/usePlantAILookup.ts` uses `chatCompletionWithFallback` which does **not** implement the multi-model retry loop, while `aiSuggestions.ts` has an explicit fallback chain (`mistral-small` → `llama-3.3-70b`). Both surfaces should share the same resilience strategy; consider unifying on the explicit fallback loop. 

- [x] **AI-9** *(resolved)* The AI design docs now describe the proxy-only flow and the dedicated backend settings endpoints.


## User supplied comment regarding: **AI-8** * DO not have fallback to other models. Present error, and do not continue

## Phase 2 — Internationalization

**Goal**: Full i18n infrastructure, English + Dutch translations, locale-aware formatting.

> Design spec: `docs/i18n-and-plant-library-architecture.md`

- [ ] **2.1** — Install `i18next`, `react-i18next`, `i18next-browser-languagedetector`; configure TypeScript namespace augmentation
- [ ] **2.2** — Extract ~140 hardcoded strings from `App.tsx`, `EventsBar`, `ToolBar`, and all dialogs into `app/i18n/locales/en/{ui,plants,calendar,errors}.json`
- [ ] **2.3** — Replace `MONTH_ABBR` array with `Intl.DateTimeFormat`; use `Intl.NumberFormat` for cm/mm values throughout
- [ ] **2.4** — Dutch (nl) translations: `ui.json`, `plants.json`, `errors.json`
- [ ] **2.5** — Plant name translations: en + nl entries for all built-in plants
- [ ] **2.6** — Language switcher in Settings (detect browser language on first visit; persist choice in Dexie)

---

## Phase 3 — Backend, Intelligence & Multi-User

**Goal**: Secure AI + weather proxies, shared plant library, Supabase auth, per-user data sync.

> Design: [`docs/product-vision.md`](docs/product-vision.md) (tiers, auth, role model) · API key security & proxy: [`docs/architecture-decisions.md`](docs/architecture-decisions.md) · Plant library schema: [`docs/i18n-and-plant-library-architecture.md`](docs/i18n-and-plant-library-architecture.md)

### Backend & Intelligence (3.1–3.8)

- [ ] **3.1** — Hono v4 backend on Cloudflare Workers
- [x] **3.2** — AI proxy endpoint (hides OpenRouter key server-side; removes BYOK requirement) — **done in Phase 1** via `POST /api/ai/chat` on the Express backend
- [ ] **3.3** — Weather proxy endpoint (optional — Open-Meteo is already free/keyless)
- [ ] **3.4** — AI-enhanced suggestion engine via proxy
- [ ] **3.5** — Shared plant library: Cloudflare D1 schema + seed data (en + nl)
- [ ] **3.6** — Plant library API (`GET /plants`, `GET /plants?since=` delta sync)
- [ ] **3.7** — Client-side plant library sync (background, silent fallback to bundled)
- [ ] **3.8** — Rate limiting + per-user usage tracking

### Multi-User & Auth (3.9–3.13)

- [ ] **3.9** — Supabase Auth (email/password + optional OAuth)
- [ ] **3.10** — Per-user data schema in Postgres (`workspace_id`, `user_id`, RLS policies)
- [ ] **3.11** — Row-Level Security enforcement + data isolation tests
- [ ] **3.12** — Dexie ↔ Supabase bi-directional sync adapter
- [ ] **3.13** — Plant contribution form + community moderation workflow

---

## Stretch / Future

- [ ] PWA + service worker (offline-first, installable on mobile)
- [ ] Image uploads + storage (Phase 3+)
- [ ] Additional locales: de, fr (after Phase 2)
- [ ] Undo/redo stack for destructive actions
- [ ] Community features (share garden layouts)
- [ ] Accessibility audit (axe/Lighthouse) + keyboard navigation pass

## Scratchpad.

This section is for vague ideas that need to be refined into stories.

### Multi plant editing / smart grouping.

I'm considering that Same plants that touch will be treated as one plant for suggestions, pests and treatments.

A planter full or partly full with say for example strawberry all at the same moment have pests or need fertilization, need water etc etc.

I'm thinking we can do this smartly by considering idenitcal plants in adjecent cells one metaplant. (Maybe issue with varieties? to be discussed.) 

### Plant State

We can give a plant (being 1 cell, or metaplant as above) a specific state, maybe sprouting/flowering/fruiting/losing leaves. Maybe we need to split it into 2 states, one about sprouting/flowering etc. and one about plant health, like losing leaves, leaf damage (pests, or hail),
